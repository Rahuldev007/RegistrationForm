# RegistrationForm
This is the student registration form  from web development developed by RahulDev
In order to use this project you need to install xampp and create folder name Registration in htdocs folder so that you can use localhost to test this project.
And also you need to create database called registration_form and add sql file in phpmyadmin dashboard. 
Thank you..
